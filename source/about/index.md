## What this blog is about?

This blog aims to keep record of what I am/was thinking in all aspects, either technically or mentally. Keep learning and never-stop thinking are what I believe always. Communication is another hugh issue. Hope you like it. The old site is found [here](https://wenscarl.bitbucket.io/blog/#/).
